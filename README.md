# DRIP  

DRIP is an app built to help you take care of your houseplants. Wtih a daily display of who needs taking care of today, whether it be watering or fetilizing, you won't have to guess anymore. And, of course, seasons change, environments fluctuate, so if your plant doesn't need to be watered as often as it once did, or if it's been getting a bit too crispy between waterings, you can adjust the care frequency on the fly!

## Installation

You will need to fork and clone this repository as well as the backend repository that is [linked here](https://github.com/patrick-rush/react-drip-backend).

Currently, the server is configured to run on `localhost:3000` while the frontend runs on another port. If you would like to run the backend on a different port, you can do so by changing the server variable in the `.env` file found in the root of this directory.

After running `rails s` serverside (and ensuring that it is on the correct port), you can run `npm install && npm start` in the frontend's root directory.

You're all set!
